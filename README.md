# FCC_Salon_Apointment_Scheduler
Part of freecodecamp relational database project ,on this project I learnt how to build appointment scheduler using bash script and sql
Salon Appointment Management System: This project involves the creation and management of a salon appointment system using PostgreSQL and Bash scripting. 
The initial database setup is carried out through SQL scripts, and the Bash script facilitates the interaction between customers and the salon. 
The script enables customers to schedule appointments for various services. It prompts users to provide their phone number and name,
and then offers a list of available services. Users can select a service and specify the desired appointment time. 
If the user is a returning customer, their information is retrieved from the database, otherwise, a new customer entry is created. 
The script enhances customer engagement by simplifying the appointment booking process and promoting efficient salon operations
